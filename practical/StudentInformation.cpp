/*Experiment No. 2: Develop a program in C++ to create a database of studentâ€™s
information system containing the following information: Name, roll number, Class,
Division, Date of Birth, Blood group, contact address, Telephone number, Driving license
no. and other. Construct the database with suitable member functions. Make use of
constructor, default constructor, copy constructor, destructor, static member functions,
friend class, this pointer, inline code and dynamic memory allocation operators-new and
delete as well as exception handling.*/
